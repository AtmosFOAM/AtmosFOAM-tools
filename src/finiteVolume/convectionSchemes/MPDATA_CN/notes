Change
Tf = max(Tf, minTf);
to
Tf = sqrt(sqr(Tf) + sqr(minTf))

No oscillaitons at 0.2. Very small osicllations at 0.5. T < 0.947214

Remove the 
max(1-2*offCentre, scalar(0))*faceFlux*dt*(Uf & gradTbyT)*Tf
term from anteD
Corrections too big at 0.2. 
Corrections too big and oscillations at 0.5
Put back.

Remove the corrections for gradTbyT and Uf
Completely smooth at 0.2. T<0.947
Oscillations at 0.5. T < 1.15

Corrections for gradTbyT but not Uf
Completely smooth at 0.2 T<0.9562
Tiny oscillations at 0.5 T<0.9472

Calculate Tc after adding SMALL to Tf
no worse

Remove 2nd term of minTf calculaation
Unstable

Make minTf calculattion from all positive terms
Even more unstable

Use Tf to calculate gradTbyT rather than Tc
Oscillations at 0.5 slightly worse

Use gradT rather than gradTbyT and do not correct it
Bigger oscillations. T<1.1493

Same but correcting gradT
Oscallations small again. 

Correct Uf again
Same small oscillations at 0.5

Tf += minTf; instead of RMS
Same small osicllations

minTf = 4* ... instead of 2
Oscillations gone. T<0.947471
